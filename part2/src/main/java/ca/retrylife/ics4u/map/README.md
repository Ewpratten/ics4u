# Lakes / Oceans / Continents Assignment

## Program usage

### World interaction

"splashes" of water can be placed in any empty part of the map with a *left click*. This will recursively fill the area with the appropriate type of water. Land can also be created and removed with a *right click* anywhere on the map. This will also update surrounding bodies of water to reflect state changes if needed (cutting of a section of water from an ocean will turn it into a lake).

### Program controls

These are the possible program controls:
```
CTRL + S --> Save the map
CTRL + L --> Load the map from a save file (if found)
CTRL + R --> Re-generate the map from scratch
```

## Software design
