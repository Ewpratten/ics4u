# Object Assignment
ICS4U<br>
By: Evan Pratten

## Question 1
`String book = "Coral Island";` is a String, containing the book name, scoped to the class. This means, that all methods can access it with the `this` keyword once an object of that class has been instantiated. EX. `this.book = "name";`.

Whereas `Book book = new Book();` is a Book object, specifically scoped to the `main()` method. It can only be accessed from inside `main()`.

## Question 2
`Book book = new Book();` will create a new object of type "Book", and store it in a variable named `book`.

## Question 3
Line 23 is printing the object's location in memory, with the following format: `<package>@<address>`

## Question 4
The book's name can be printed from the constructor, as the object will have been constructed by the time the variable is accessed. `main()` could not do this, because it is static.

```java
Book() {
    Chapter chapter = new Chapter();
    System.out.println(this.book);
}
```

## Question 5-9
These questions are answered [in the code](https://github.com/Ewpratten/ics4u/blob/master/part2/src/main/java/ca/retrylife/ics4u/objasn/Book.java).

## Question 10
"this.title = title + n;" and not
"title = title + n;

The `this` references the class-scoped variable, not the one defined in the method. This will append "chapter" and `n` to the chapter title. Not to the local variable.

## Bonus
Here is a walkthrough of my solution:

### Basic book
I started with the line:

```java
Book book = new Book();
```

3 books. Not bad. A quick way to get another "book" in there is to cast it to a `Book`

```java
Book book = (Book) (new Book());
```

Java also lets you cast up and down. So, I can get another "book" by casting down to an `Object`, and back up to a `Book`

```java
Book book = (Book) ((Object) ((Book) (new Book())));
```

One thing that has yet to be touched is the variable name. Java allows multiple variables of the same type to be defined on the same line (comma seperated). So, why not add every possible variation of "book"?

```java
Book bOok, boOk, booK, BOok, bOOk, boOK, BooK, BOOk, bOOK, BOOK = (Book) ((Object) ((Book) (new Book())));
```

Now, for infinite books. In one line, we can also:
 - make an array
 - fill it
 - Grab the first element

And so, here is what happens if we add an array into the mix:


```java
Book bOok, boOk, booK, BOok, bOOk, boOK, BooK, BOOk, bOOK, BOOK = new Book[] {(Book) ((Object) ((Book) (new Book()))), (Book) ((Object) ((Book) (new Book())))}[0];
```

This array contains 2 new books, and gives us 18 occurences of "book". Of course, we can add an infinite number of books to the book array, but where is the fun in that?

We can now cast the book array to a book, wrap it as an element of a generic `Object` array, then cass the `Object` back to a book:

```java
Book bOok, boOk, booK, BOok, bOOk, boOK, BooK, BOOk, bOOK, BOOK = (Book) new Object[]{ (Book) new Book[] {(Book) ((Object) ((Book) (new Book()))), (Book) ((Object) ((Book) (new Book())))}[0]}[0];
```

That is 20 books.

Now, for my creation, stanting 3555 books tall:
```java
Book bOok,boOk,booK,BOok,bOOk,boOK,BooK,BOOk,bOOK,BOOK=(Book)new Object[]{(Book)new Book[]{(Book)((Object)((Book)(new Book()))),(Book)((Object)((Book)(new Book()))),(Book)((Object)((Book)(new
